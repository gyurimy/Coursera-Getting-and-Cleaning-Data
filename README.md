A full description of the data:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The data for the project:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

####Steps
-----
1. Unzip the data for the project
2. Download the "run_analysis.R" file
3. Change current working directory to the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder
4. Run "run_analysis.R" file
5. Confirm the result data set in the current directory (result_cleaning_dataset.txt, result_cleaning_dataset.csv)
